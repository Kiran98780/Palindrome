# Next Palindrome Number
This project finds the next palindrome number for a given input number.\
There are 2 methods described in the project.\
Palindrome.java - This file implements method 1 is a naive method where the count of the number is incremented by 1 to compute the palindrome. The complexity is O(N).\
Next_Palindrome.java - This file implements method 2 has a log N complexity and considers 6 different cases for even and odd numbers.\
The maximum number of digits that can have the next palindrome computed is 10.\
In order to run the project, download the source code and open either using IntelliJ Idea IDE. Then build and run the code.
